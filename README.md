# pen_cil
takes image and gives the appearance of it being pencil-drawn - built originally for cellular-automata

to run: simply download both conf & libs in the same directory, & from the console run python3 conf.py - each index of the list of line_params corresponds to one of the unique-colors in the source-img.
